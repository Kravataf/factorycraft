FACTORYCRAFT IS MADE IN GDEVELOP 5 SO IF U WANT TO EDIT IT IMPORT THE .json FILE INTO NEW FOLDER THEN ADD ALL OF THE EXTENSIONS/PLUGINS

this is just a prototype not a game!! its completely broken if youre not the host of the server, theres 3 seconds delay in
every action. also camera only follows the host because the new version of THNK multiplayer framework changed some stuff...
github wont allow me to upload the textures so youre gonna have to add them manually i guess

heres list of plugins you need to make the .json file work after putting it in gdevelop 5

THNK_Relay
THNK_Local
PanelSpriteButton
Health
THNK
SnapToGrid
