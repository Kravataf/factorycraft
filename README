this is just a prototype not a game!! its completely broken if youre not the host of the server, theres 3 seconds delay in
movement and you cant break blocks. also camera only follows the host because the new version of THNK multiplayer framework changed some stuff...

heres list of plugins you need to make the .json file work after putting it in gdevelop 5

THNK_Relay
THNK_Local
THNK_P2P
PanelSpriteButton
Health
THNK
SnapToGrid
